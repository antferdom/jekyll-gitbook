## Usage
To use flamapy, any user can assume different roles. In this page, we organize the content by them. For the flamapy installation, follow [Installation guide]({% link _posts/2022-06-12-1-installation.md %})

## As an end user
As an end user you might be interested on executing your analysis either from the command line or from your python script.

### From the command line. 
The execution from the command line is very straigt forward. We rely on the Flamapy cli interface. 

```bash
$flamapy-admin cli use_operation_from_file Valid <Path to file>
```

There are some analysis operations that require to pass a predefine configuration. More information on how to define such files in TODO. Please note that the extension of files should be `csvconf`

```bash
$flamapy-admin cli use_operation_from_file --configuration_file <path to csv file>.csvconf ValidProduct <path to model file> 
```

For example:
```bash
$flamapy-admin cli use_operation_from_file --configuration_file ../test/test.csvconf ValidProduct ../test/output.uvl 
```
### From a user python script.
To execute a simple operation in our script we should import the discover module and simply call the operation. This module have a function called DiscoverMetamodels to use the operations of diferents plugins. This function is defined as:
- **operation**: the name of the operation we want to use
- **filename**: the file containing the model required to apply the operation
- **plugin**: an optional parameter to specify the plugin containing the operation (use in case of repeted names of operations) 
- **configuration_file**: the file containing a configuration (this is optional in case we need to analyse a configuration)

For example:

```python
from flamapy.core.discover import DiscoverMetamodels # This loads the tool in the python execution environment
dm = DiscoverMetamodels() # Instantiate the class
result = dm.use_operation_from_file(operation, filename) # This launch the operation and stores the result on the result variable
print(result) # to print the result
```
Then you can printout the result or perform any other operation on it. 

In case of executing an operation that requires optional paramenters:

```python
from flamapy.core.discover import DiscoverMetamodels # This loads the tool in the python execution environment
dm = DiscoverMetamodels() # Instantiate the class
result = dm.use_operation_from_file(operation, filename, configuration_file=configuration_file) # This launch the operation and stores the result on the result variable
print(result) # to print the result
```

For example:

```python
from flamapy.core.discover import DiscoverMetamodels # This loads the tool in the python execution environment
dm = DiscoverMetamodels() # Instantiate the class
result = dm.use_operation_from_file('Valid', './test.uvl', configuration_file='./test.csvconf') # This launch the operation and stores the result on the result variable
print(result) # to print the result
```

More information on how to define such files as follows. Please note that the extension of configuration files should be `csvconf`.

### Configuration files
In this way a product is defined in a 'csvconf' file, naming the selected features that make up the product:
```
feature 1
...
feature N
```

In this way a configuration is defined in a 'csvconf' file, naming the features that should (True) or should not (False) be selected, always separated by commas:
```
feature 1, True
...
feature N, False
```

## As a developer

As a developer you might be interested on using a rest api to consume or analyze your feature models. For that, make sure that you have installed the plugins using pip and simple start a REST API SERVER as showin in the following instructions. 

### Command line CLI and HTTP API

We rely on the Hug library to expose an API to consume flamapy

To execute the API you need to:
```bash
$git clone https://github.com/flamapy/core.git
```
Then, `cd` into the core directory containing all the source files and exec the following commands

```
hug -f flamapy/endpoint/diverso_lab.py  # mount the endpoint in port 8000
# Doc: hug generate doc in json when you access to no exist endpoint
http://localhost:8000/example/
# Example
http://localhost:8000/v1/get-plugins/
http://localhost:8000/v1/get-operations/pysat_metamodel/
http://localhost:8000/v1/use-operation-from-file/Valid/test.xml
```
