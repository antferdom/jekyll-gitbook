## Usage
To use flamapy, any user can assume different roles. In this wiki page, we organize the content by the two main roles.
### Installation

For installation, follow [Installation guide]({% link _posts/2022-06-12-1-installation.md %})

## As an end user
As an end user you might be interested on executing your analysis either from the command line or from your python script.

### From the command line. 
The execution from the command line is very straigt forward. We rely on the Flamapy cli interface. 

```bash
$flamapy-admin cli use_operation_from_file Valid <Path to file>
```

TODO explain how to pass parameters
### From a user python script.
To execute a simple operation in our script we should import the module and simply call the operation. For example

```python
from flamapy.core.discover import DiscoverMetamodels # This loads the tool in the python execution environment
dm = DiscoverMetamodels() # Instantiate the class
result = dm.use_operation_from_file(operation, filename) # This launch the operation and stores the result on the result variable
print(result) # to print the result
```
Then you can printout the result or perform any other operation on it.

## As a developer

As a developer you might be interested on using a rest api to consume or analyze your feature models. For that, make sure that you have installed the plugins using pip and simple start a REST API SERVER as showin in the following instructions. 

### Command line CLI and HTTP API

We rely on the Hug library to expose an API to consume flamapy

To execute the API you need to:
```bash
$git clone https://github.com/flamapy/core.git
```
Then, `cd` into the core directory containing all the source files and exec the following commands

```
hug -f flamapy/endpoint/diverso_lab.py  # mount the endpoint in port 8000
# Doc: hug generate doc in json when you access to no exist endpoint
http://localhost:8000/example/
# Example
http://localhost:8000/v1/get-plugins/
http://localhost:8000/v1/get-operations/pysat_metamodel/
http://localhost:8000/v1/use-operation-from-file/Valid/test.xml
```
